 LLM’s Side by Side is a lightweight web interface for comparing AI language model responses in real time. It features two side‑by‑side panels with selectable models, a unified prompt input, and asynchronous API calls (via a PHP proxy to manage CORS) that display distinct outputs from each model for easy comparison.
